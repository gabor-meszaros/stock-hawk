# Stock Hawk

*Stock Hawk* is an Android app that you can use to get information about stock data.

The application is part of Udacity's [Google Associate Android Developer Fast Track](https://www.udacity.com/course/associate-android-developer-fast-track--nd818) as its final project.

## How to contribute

Thank you, but please do not contribute. :) The app is part of the course evaluation process thus it should contain my work only. Nevertheless, you can open an issue if you think there are things which need to be improved. I appreciate if you help me to be a better developer.
